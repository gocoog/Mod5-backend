# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.destroy_all

# p1 = User.create(first_name: "John", last_name: "Smith", email_address: "john@mail.com", password: "pass")

# p2 = User.create(first_name: "shivvy", last_name: "dave", email_address: "shiv@mail.com", password: "pass")

# c1 = User.create(first_name: "alex", last_name: "smith", email_address: "alex@mail.com", password: "pass", adult: false)
# c2 = User.create(first_name: "will", last_name: "smith", email_address: "will@mail.com", password: "pass", adult: false)

# p1.children << c1
# p1.children << c2

# w1 = Wallet.create
